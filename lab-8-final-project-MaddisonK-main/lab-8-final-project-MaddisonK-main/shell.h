This function will parse the command (cmd for short) and its arguments specified 
by the user.  

HINT(s): This function is essentially an exercise in string parsing. 

        EXAMPLE#1 (Built-in) if the user enters

				cd /mnt/cdrom

		at the shell prompt, line would contain "cd /mnt/cdrom". 
		Using the space character as the delimiter, the fields in 
		the command struct would be:

				- path = "cd"
				- argc = 2
				- argv = {"cd", "/mnt/cdrom", NULL} 

        EXAMPLE#2, if the user enters

				ls -la

		at the shell prompt, line would contain "ls -la". Using the 
		space character as the delimiter, the fields in the command 
		struct would be:

				- path = "/bin/ls"
				- argc = 2
				- argv = {"ls", "-la", NULL} 

        EXAMPLE#3, if the user enters nothing at the shell prompt (i.e. 
        simply hits the return key), path and argv would NULL, and 
        argc is set to 0:

				- path = NULL
				- argc = 0
				- argv = NULL 

		EXAMPLE#4, if the user enters a command that does not exist at 
		the shell prompt (i.e. echi "brent"), path is set to command, 
		argv would be NULL, and argc is set to -1:

				- path = "echi"
				- argc = -1
				- argv = NULL
 
 function:
	- parameter(s): char* pointer that contains the cmd and its arguments, 
					and a pointer to an existing command_t structure

This function will only execute external commands (cmd for short), such as ls 
or cp, using the execv system function. In the execute function, you must fork 
a child process. 

 HINT(s): 
 (1) An example is provided that demonstrates how the fork and wait operations 
 	are coded (see "Executing a Command" section in assignment writeup).
 (2) The execv is assuming the full path name for the cmd is provided (i.e. the 
 	exact file location, starting from / or the root folder). For instance, simply 
 	providing the "pwd" cmd is equivalent to "./pwd" (i.e. pwd cmd is located in 
 	the same folder as parent process). Instead, the full path (/bin/pwd) must be 
 	given. An incomplete code segment is provided below.

			if ( p_cmd->argc > 0 ) {
				if ( fork() == 0 ) {
					execv( p_cmd->path, p_cmd->argv );
					...
				}
				wait( ... );
			} else if ( p_cmd->argc == -1 ) {
				// display to user cmd not found
			}


 
 function:
	- parameter(s): pointer to a command_t structure
    - return: status code from wait function.

This function is used to determine if the named command (cmd for short) entered by 
the user in the shell can be found in one of the folders defined in the PATH 
environment (env for short) variable.

HINT(s): Use the getenv() system function to retrieve the folders defined in the 
		PATH env variable. An small code segment is shown below that demonstrates 
		how to retrieve folders defined in your PATH.

			char* path_env_variable;
			path_env_variable = getenv( "PATH" );
			printf("PATH = %s\n", path_env_variable );

		The format of the PATH is very simple, the ':' character is delimiter, 
		i.e. used to mark the beginning and end of a folder defined in the path.

		Write a loop that parses each folder defined in the path, then uses this 
		folder along with the stat function (see "File/Directory Status" section 
		in the assignment writeup).
 
 function:
	- parameter(s): char* pointer that has named command (e.g. ls), and a pointer 
	  to an existing command_t structure. If found in path, it sets the cmd 
	  struct path field to the fully qualified path of the named command (e.g. 
	  p_cmd->path = "/bin/ls"), else it simply puts sets the path field to the named 
	  command (e.g. p_cmd->path="ls").
	- return: TRUE if named command is in the PATH, or FALSE if not in the PATH.
